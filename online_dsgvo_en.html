<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Version: 14. August 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction and Responsible Party</h2>
<p>My name is Sabri Alpan (E-Mail: <a href="mailto:sabalp2012+support@gmail.com">sabalp2012+support@gmail.com</a>).</p>
<p>I am the sole developer of the app "Shift25", offered free on the Google Play Store. Protecting your privacy is important to me. I comply with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<h2>2. Responsibility</h2>
<p>For data processing within the scope of Google services (e.g., AdMob, Firebase), the responsible party is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. For questions about the app itself, please contact me as the developer.</p>

<h2>3. What data is processed and for what purpose?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>No personal data: The app does not process any personal data. You can use the app without providing any personal information.</li>
    <li>Google AdMob (Advertising): To finance the app, advertising banners are displayed via Google AdMob. Consent for personalized or non-personalized ads is obtained at first app start using the Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK. Without consent, no ads are shown. Processing is based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).</li>
    <li>Firebase Analytics: Firebase Analytics is used to anonymously analyze technical app usage. Only general usage data (e.g., which app sections were opened) is collected anonymously. No content, timestamps, or sensitive details are stored. The data is used solely to improve the app technically.</li>
    <li>Firebase Remote Config: Used to control individual app features. No personal data is processed here either.</li>
    <li>Automatic Data Backup (Google AutoBackup): The app may store data on your device automatically backed up to the cloud by Google. This backup is managed exclusively by Google and subject to their privacy policies. The app itself has no access to the cloud data.</li>
    <li>Storage of consent: Your consent for advertising is stored exclusively locally on your device. No transfer to third parties or server storage occurs.</li>
    <li>Subscription for ad-free use: The app offers a paid subscription to remove ads. Subscription management and payment are done exclusively via Google Play Store and Google Ireland Limited billing. Payment data is processed by Google only.</li>
</ul>
<p>Processing of payment data fulfills the purchase contract under Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. The developer receives no direct payment or personal data from the purchase process.</p>
<p>Users can manage, pause or cancel subscriptions anytime via the Google Play Store under "Manage subscriptions". Subscriptions disable ads.</p>

<h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to information, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, and objection regarding your data. Contact: <a href="mailto:sabalp2012+support@gmail.com">sabalp2012+support@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>You can withdraw or change consent anytime in the app under "Menu → Privacy". If declined or withdrawn, no more data is collected. Previously stored analytics data can be deleted in-app via the "Privacy" section.</p>
<p>Withdrawal and cancellation: Consent for data processing can be withdrawn anytime in the app under "Privacy". Subscriptions can be managed or canceled anytime under "Manage subscriptions" in Google Play Store. After cancellation, subscription remains active until period end; ads reappear after.</p>

<h2>5. Data transfer and storage</h2>
<p>Processing may occur outside the EU (e.g. USA). Google uses standard contractual clauses ensuring adequate data protection.</p>

<h2>6. Contact</h2>
<p>Voluntary contact (email or via <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4HzMUp5gifF-OXKZdCoCeQ6Yby0K--1/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support page</a>) will only be used to handle requests and deleted on demand.</p>

<h2>7. Links to third parties</h2>
<p>Ads or external links may lead to third-party sites. The developer assumes no responsibility for their content or privacy.</p>

<h2>8. Right to complain</h2>
<p>You can file complaints with data protection authorities. See: <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/edpb_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.edpb.europa.eu/edpb_en</a></p>
